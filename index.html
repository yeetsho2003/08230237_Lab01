                <p>
                    Samtse College of Education was founded by Bhutan's Third Dharma King Late His Majesty Jigme Dorji
                    Wangchuck. Launched as a Teacher Training Institute on 29th May 1968, the institute commenced its educational journey with only 41 students and a few teacher educators. Since its establishment the College has given the country's education system over 5000 graduates with primary teaching certificate, bachelors, diploma, postgraduate diploma, and Masters qualifications. The rich and varied learning experiences we offer our students are inspired by our philosophical commitment to the wisdom of right View, right Contemplation and right Action which collectively can cause the arising of the right Result.
